            Milt Jackson, byname of Milton Jackson, also called Bags, (born January 1, 1923, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.—died October 9, 1999, New York, New York), American jazz musician, the first and most influential vibraphone improviser of the postwar, modern jazz era.</div>

                Jackson began playing the vibraphone (also called vibes or vibraharp) professionally at age 16. He attended Michigan State University and joined Dizzy Gillespie’s sextet in 1945; he then worked with Gillespie’s big band and later returned to play vibraphone and piano in Gillespie’s sextet (1950–52). He also freelanced with leading bop musicians in New York City and played in the Woody Herman band (1949–50). He was a cofounder of the Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ), which was his principal performance vehicle during 1952–74, and he subsequently played in numerous MJQ reunion tours. Meanwhile, he recorded often as sideman, including classic sessions with Thelonious Monk (“Evidence,” “Criss Cross,” “Straight, No Chaser”) and Miles Davis (“Bags’ Groove”), and as leader, including performances with top tenor saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, John Coltrane, and Lucky Thompson. He continued to tour and record in the 1990s; one of his last recordings was with jazz legends Oscar Peterson and Ray Brown, with whom Jackson had formed the Very Tall Band years earlier.</p>

                <p class="text-dark fs-5">Before Milt Jackson, there were only two major vibraphonists: Lionel Hampton and Red Norvo. Jackson soon surpassed both of them in significance and, despite the rise of other players (including Bobby Hutcherson and Gary Burton), still won the popularity polls throughout the decades. Jackson (or "Bags" as he was long called) was at the top of his field for 50 years, playing bop, blues, and ballads with equal skill and sensitivity. In its essence, Jackson did for the vibes what Dizzy Gillespie did for the trumpet -- revolutionize its approach. He slowed the speed on the instrument's oscillator, changed its vibrato and perfected slow, cleverly paced blues solos. His floating solos with long, sustained notes and darting rhythms became a bop staple. A former singer, guitarist and pianist, Jackson was an extremely versatile player, cutting big-band dates, working with orchestras, and fighting to maintain a successful solo career yet retain his ties with the Modern Jazz Quartet, the group he co-founded with pianist John Lewis in 1952.</p>
                    
                <p class="text-dark fs-5">A fluent player with compelling swing who conceived in long lines of eighth and sixteenth notes, Jackson created an original style out of bebop’s advanced harmonies and irregular accenting. By manipulating his vibrato speed he achieved a unique depth and beauty of expression on the vibraphone, a traditionally “cold” instrument, adding special warmth to his playing of ballads and medium-tempo blues. Jackson brought to his musical settings a highly developed sensitivity to balance and contrast, which made much of his playing with the MJQ muted when compared with his aggressive work in his own groups.</p>

                <p class="text-dark fs-5">He left the MJQ in 1974, leading his own groups or playing with all-star aggregations until 1981, when the MJQ reunited for a concert in Japan. Following that concert, the quartet made annual tours from 1982 through the early 1990s. For most of the remainder of his career he worked with his own groups, which often included such musicians as Mickey Roker, Bob Cranshaw, and Mike LeDonne.</p>

                <p class="text-dark fs-5">The winner of numerous jazz polls, Jackson's vibe-playing dominated the field for much of his career, leading to his induction into the Percussion Hall of Fame and DownBeat Jazz Hall of Fame, among other honors.</p></div>
